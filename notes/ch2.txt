Telemetry

we need to instrument our application to collect telemetry data.
telemetry data provides *observability*, which in turn gives us ability to troubleshoot when something unexpected happens.

Logs are plaintext data that describes an occurence. 'log' crate can be used for logging
log provides 5 macros, ordered from least to most severe: trace, debug, info, warn and error.

actix-web also comes bundled with a logger

ask yourself if logs are a proper abstraction for your needs.
'tracing' crate expands on logging-based observability by capturing the entire span of the executing program.

give yourself an option to skip tracing when you're running tests.
remember to explicitly leave out sensitive data from the logs (passwords, etc)
